## Hi there, I'm Alessio Devoto 👋


- 👨‍🎓 I'm a PhD student in Data Science at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ALESSIO-DEVOTO_nP1701081_IT.aspx)
- 🌱 Working with [Simone Scardapane](https://www.sscardapane.it) on efficient and interpretable machine learning models
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Visiting researcher at Edinburgh NLP with [Pasquale Minervini](https://neuralnoise.com/)

### 🔬 Research Interests

My work spans both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, with a focus on **Efficient Training & Inference** for Language and Vision Models, **AI Interpretability** and **Adaptive & Conditional Computation** methods.

## Blog & Resources

I write about deep learning, AI efficiency, and interpretability on my [blog](https://alessiodevoto.github.io/blog/). Check it out for tutorials and insights!

## Beyond Research

- 📈 Training as a certified Life & Business Coach with the [International Coaching Federation](https://coachingfederation.org)
- 🇪🇸 Former Erasmus student at [Universidad Politecnica de Valencia](http://www.upv.es/es), Spain
- 🏛️ Classical languages enthusiast - I teach Ancient Greek and Latin to high school and college students
